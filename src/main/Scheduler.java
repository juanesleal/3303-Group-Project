// apperently this system is responsible for handling faults like an elevator's doors not opening,
// an elevator getting stuck between floors, and packet loss...
// I'm not sure how you would solve these issues without just designing them out ie: get reply messages for everything,
// and make sure an elevator doesn't move until it gets a reply.
// The elevator should just be designed to never move if the doors are open... why should the scheduler have to do this?
